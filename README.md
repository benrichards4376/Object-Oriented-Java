# Object-Oriented-Java
These are Java projects that are more Object-Oriented than in the "Java" Repository These are more advanced exercises I implemented while taking Object-Oriented Programming at UCF. The group project was worked on with a partner and was our final project in the class.

For more basic Java programs that don't use objects see "Basic-Java"
